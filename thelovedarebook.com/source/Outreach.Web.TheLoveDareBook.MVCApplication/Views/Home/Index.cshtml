    <h2>About the Authors</h2>
    <div align="left">
        Alex and Stephen Kendrick serve on the pastoral staff at Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, GA. They began working in film when surveys showed how churches respond so positively to film as a ministry tool. They have since founded Sherwood Pictures, a production company dedicated to bringing Christian life-change to moviegoers all over the world. Their last film, Facing the Giants (2006), has been called “the surprise theatrical hit of 2007” and drew positive feedback from viewers in the ministry and secular film industry alike.
